# Creating a new view

To create a new view, create a Pug file. It is common to put this file in its own directory with the same name, to group the page, styling and optional models together. A single page can contain many flutter-views.

## Importing Dart dependencies

### Default imports

By default, the following imports are added to **** generated Dart files:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'
import 'package:flutter/cupertino.dart';
```

You can [add additional default imports](configuring-flutter-view.md#imports) using **flutter-view.json**.

### Adding imports

To import additional packages in a Pug or HTML file, use the import tag with the package parameter:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pug" %}
```css
import(package='flutter_view_widgets/flutter_view_widgets.dart')
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

To import files in a Pug or HTML file, use the import tag with the file parameter. The files are relative to the current file directory:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pug" %}
```css
import(file='../directory/test.dart')
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Creating Flutter-views

A flutter-view is transformed into a Dart function. As such, you are just writing Dart functions in an HTML-like format.

### Method body

The format of a flutter view in Pug is as follows:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pug" %}
```pug
method-name(flutter-view [optional parameters])
    ...method body...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This will render into the following Dart:

```dart
MethodName([optional parameters]) {
    return ...method body...
}
```

The method name in HTML or Pug is dash-cased, and gets transformed into camel-case. The same is true for the parameters.

Note: The generated Dart functions start in uppercase. This is so they can be called from other flutter-views, as will become clear in a moment.

### Adding Parameters

Parameters are defined as follows:

`:parameter-name[type]?`

The **\[type]** and **?** are optional:

* The type becomes the type of the parameter in the Dart function. If omitted, it it is considered dynamic
* By default, parameters you specify are required. Adding a **?** at the end indicates that they are optional.

Example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Pug" %}
```pug
task-list-item(flutter-view :task-model[TaskList] :task[Task] :done?)
    ...widgets that show the task...
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

This will render into the following Dart:

```dart
TaskListItem({ @required TaskList taskModel, @required Task task, done) {
    return ...widgets that show the task..
}
```
